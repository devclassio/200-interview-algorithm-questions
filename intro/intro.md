# Intro

I've been coding for nearly a decade. In that time my relationships with algorithms and data structures has changed a lot. During my undergraduate studies they were pretty interesting concepts! However, school was very theoritcal. I didn't fully appreciate the material since I hadn't encountered any "hard" problems as a fresh programmer. Plus, with a little little javascript magic and some npm modules I was able to build some cool apps, so who needed these things anyways? Therefore, I labelled the study of algorithms and data structures as interesting but primarily intellectual postering.

## Turning Point

After a startup attempt I found myself prepping for job interviews. I couldn't escape algorithms and data structures for long because these are the main components of programming interview. Acknowledging this as a necessary evil I started the normal interview prep grind. I felt that my school's CS materials were very boring and I preferred studying in english so I picked up some recommended books and courses online. To my surprrise I actually enjoyed studying this time around. Some of the materials were able to make CS theory accessible and relatable! More importantly, I realized that I had become a better developer during this process! I had learned new programming patterns / idioms and how to properly model problems. Suddenly, things clicked! In a span of 2 weeks I was able to understand and enjoy materials which I had studied for months and dreaded. I realized that the material was fascinating but the problem was with the resources I was using to study.

## What is devclass?

Devclass is the resource **I wish I had when learning computer science**. Me and Assaf are not reinventing computer science theory, nor have we spent months putting together brand new interview questions. We're aiming to write about the essentials, in an engaging, memorable and accessible way. We'll tie every subject into day to day life and explain:

- where you might encounter these concepts in the wild
- what the benefits are in understanding them

## who this is for?

- we're building devclass to scratch our own itch.
- this is not for the complete beginner -- we think that the folks who will get the most value out of dev class are those who have a little programming experience under their belt. There are ample resources to get beginners started!
- This isn't leetcode! ther are also a ton of (great) resources out that aggregate questions for interviews.
- the ideal reader is interested breaking the barrier between theoritical and practical with cs theory and real life use cases
- the ideal readier is interested in maximizing their ROI (time!) when preparing for interviews by building lasting knowledge
- the ideal reader is a geek :)

## great resources / should I use this instead of LeetCode / Cracking the Coding interview etc?

this blog / book stands on the shoulders of giants. There is no replacement or shortcut for actually practicing writing code. This book should be used as a companion to your CTCI / Leetcode binge. We've reviewed hundreds of CS problems and give our take on them here! Ideally, this book will help develop a framework for thinking and understanding these problems :)
