CTCI, page 111, Trees and Graphs

You are implementing a BT class from scratch, which, in addition to 
insert, find and delete has a method getRandomNode() which returns 
a random node from the tree. All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen.

Design and implement an algorithm for getRandomNode, and explain how you would
implement the rest of the nodes.
